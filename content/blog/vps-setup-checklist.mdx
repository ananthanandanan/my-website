A short reference for bringing up a new VPS: users, SSH, firewall, and basics.

## 1. Create a non-root user

Always avoid running as root for day-to-day work.

## 2. SSH hardening

Disable password auth, use keys only.

## 3. Firewall

UFW or nftables, allow only what you need.

That's the core. The rest is app-specific.
